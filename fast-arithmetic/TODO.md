# ATS library
- [ ] stack-allocated big integers?
- [x] Package debianization
  - [ ] Header files that work with GMP
# Haskell library
- [ ] Consider backpack and/or pure haskell library for when ATS fails?
# Performance
- [ ] Consider view type for appending arrays?
- [ ] make `jacobi` faster
- [ ] make `totientSum` use the right algorithm
- [ ] Use factorial etc. for derangement formula?
- [ ] `bell` is slow compared to haskell?
# Functions
